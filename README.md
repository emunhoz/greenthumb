#### About this app
- At the begining I setup Prettier, ESLint and EditorConfig code patterns
- For the components I decided to use styled-components to style, because it keep the code very clean and it's very friendly
- For testing I've used `cypress` because is there a flow with beginning and end
- For requests I decided to use axios cause is very simple to use
